		 *  
		 *  2. (optional) use a text editor or notepad++ to save a file as .java
		 *  
		 *  3. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/linux) on your computer
		 *  
		 *  4. set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19\bin (this is where your JDK is located)
		 *  	your jdk version may be different, check to see what your number is
		 *  
		 *  5. cd C:\Users\(userName)\Desktop     (or whatever path the file is you want)
		 *  
		 *  6. javac FileName.java (to compile)
		 *  	this will become byte code
		 *  
		 *  7. java FileName (to run a .class file, it's protable)
